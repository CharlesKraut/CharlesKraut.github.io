				<h4>Why Silver?</h4>
				<h5>A tangible store of value</h5>
				<p>Silver is the lesser-known precious metal.  The best conductor of heat and electricity known to man, silver has 3,800 industrial uses and counting.</p>
				<p>For decades the world has used more silver than it has mined each year. The resulting deficit could result in a price explosion in the not-too-distant future.</p>
				<p> Silver is also much more useful than gold in barter in the event of a currency collapse. Most important, silver is an industrial and a precious metal in high demand and declining supply.  It has investment potential unlike any other asset.</p>
				<p>Governments cannot create more silver nor diminish its value.</p>

				<h4>Why Foreign Currencies?</h4>
				<h5>A hedge against the declining U.S. Dollar</h5>
				<p>The U.S. Dollar has been in decline almost since 1913 when the Federal Reserve was charged with preserving and maintaining its value.  Since then the dollar has lost more than 96% of its value.</p>
				<p>Today, no currency is backed by precious metals.  However, certain foreign currencies have not been abused the way the U.S. Dollar has.<M/p>
				<p>China is quietly working to make the yuan the replacement currency for the U.S. Dollar.</p>
				<p>Canadaâ€™s dollar is issued by a nation of vast natural resources.</p>
				<p>The Swiss franc has already appreciated greatly against the U.S. Dollar.</p>
				<p>All three currencies have the potential to continue their long-term appreciation against the U.S. Dollar.</p>

			<h3>Current Recommendations</h3>
			<p>Silver is relatively inexpensive, but most foreign currencies have peaked against the US Dollar and are currently expensive.</p>
			<p>We always recommend that you acquire $1,000 face value of pre-1965 US dimes, quarters, and half dollars for each member of the family living at home.</p>
