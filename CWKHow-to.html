	<p>Skydiving is a pastime enjoyed by thousands of thrill-seekers.</p>
	<p>It is a sport not particularly forgiving of mistakes or oversights.</p>

	<p>To participate, some equipment is essential.  The most important is probably the parachute.</p>
	<p>Unless you are Superman, an airplane will also come in handy:</p>

		<p>Got all that?  Then let's go!</p>
		<div>
		<ol>
		<li>Get your gear together.</li>
		<li>Pack your parachute.</li>
		<div class="warning-box">
		<h3> <i class="fa fa-exclamation-triangle" aria-hidden="true"></i>Never let someone else pack your parachute!</h3>
		</div>
		<li>Make sure you have adequate life insurance.</li>
		<li>Check to see that your will is up-to-date.</li>
		<li>Schedule your flight.</li>
		<div class="detail-box">
		<h3> <i class="fa fa-info-circle" aria-hidden="true"></i>This may be the only time you will purchase a half-way ticket.. Think about that..</h3
		</div>
		</div>
		<li>Follow all instructions from the jumpmaster.</li>
		<li>Familiarize yourself with the ripcords for the main and the reserve chutes.</li>
		<li>When the jumpmaster says "jump," make sure you jump out through the open door.</li>
		<div class="detail-box">
		<h3> <i class="fa fa-info-circle" aria-hidden="true"></i>Otherwise you may have to pay the full one-way fare.</h3
		</div>
		</div>
		<li>Once out of the plane, fight the temptation to panic.  Your action is irreversible.</li>
		<li>It is advisable to pull the ripcord too early rather than too late.  Better to miss the landing zone than to impact it at high speed.</li>
		<div class="warning-box">
		<h3> <i class="fa fa-exclamation-triangle" aria-hidden="true"></i>If the first ripcord fails, try to remember that you have another one.</h3
		</div>
		</div>
		<li>If the second ripcord fails to open a parachute, you won't be needing these instructions any more.</li>
		<h2>Happy Landing!</h2>
		</ol>
