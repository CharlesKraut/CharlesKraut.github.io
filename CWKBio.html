      <img src="CWKProfPhoto1.jpg"/>
		<p>Born in New York City, Charles grew up in Westchester County, New York.  
   He received his B.A. in Social Sciences from the State University
   of New York at Stony Brook. Subsequent to his graduation he embarked upon an 
   important but almost unwitting journey of discovery.  As a result of his eforts he 
   found and joined the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in 1972.</p>
   <p>After four years in the United States Army, Charles spent two years at Brigham 
   Young University and received his MBA degree in Corporate Finance in 1978.</p>
		<p>Charles has spent the past 36 years working as a personal financial adviser, 
		serving hundreds of middle-class clients
   all over the United States. His first book <em>Moneywise: Your Guide to Keeping 
   Ahead of Inflation, Taxes, and the Declining Dollar</em>, published in 2009, 
   was written to help millions of Americans do better financially.  
   Charles continues to publish his quarterly <em>Wealth Creation and Preservation</em>
   newsletter.</p>
		<p>Charles has always been interested in liberty and the Constitution. 
   He got involved with the Constitution Party several years ago, and began 
   speaking to their gatherings and to many other groups.</P>
		<p>In connection with his public speaking, Charles wrote and published 
   two more books,</p>
   <li><em>The Patriot's Guide to Taking America Back</em>, and</li>
   <li><em>Will You Help Save Your Country?</em></li>
		<p>Both were written to help conservatives and patriots figure out what has 
		caused America's problems and provide specific solutions.</p>
